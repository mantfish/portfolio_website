                        pipeline for 3D reconstruction of underwater scenes, using a newly acquired 6 camera multi
                        camera system. I worked with this system for a while, first working with our technician to
                        integrate it onto a BlueROV. I then developed a Graphical User Interface for it, to allow us and
                        students to actually use the system, without having to know how to call ROS services.

                    <p class="pagepara">I spent a while working on a full pipeline to create 3D reconstructions of
                        underwater scenes using data from a multi camera system DTU had purchesed. All as part of the EU Horizion
                        MarcoBolo Project. I ended up writing a
                        codebase in python that could reconstruct a scene using 1 -> N cameras. During the process of
                        writing this, I learnt so much about computer vision, the challenges with underwater scenes,
                        and working on a large code base. I pretty quickly realised that me by myself was unlikely to
                        develop anything better than commercial solutions out there, but I got a lot out of the process,
                        it definitely helped me teach computer vision to our Ocean Engineering Masters students who took
                        the course "Fundamentals of Acoustics and Underwater Optical Systems", that I've been a teaching
                        assistant on from 2022 onwards.

                <div class="col-lg-7">
                    <p class="pagepara">I worked with a masters student to calibrate the cameras, and go out and
                        collect data in the waters around Copenhagen, and created a good few 3D scene reconstructions
                        using <a href="https://colmap.github.io/">Colmap</a> and other programs. I was sorry to leave
                        this project and
                        start heading into my PhD all about Argo Floats (check out the other projects!), I was just
                        getting into splatting and other state of the art 3D reconstruction methods. I'm hoping I'll come back to
                        seabed / underwater scene reconstruction in the future. I attended a meeting for the project in
                        January 2025 and presented our work and got to see what the other groups all working on
                        biodiversity monitoring were up to. I think there's a lot of potential for 3D optical systems
                        for seeing how marine eco systems are doing. It seems like a very low cost way of
                        achieving some of the biodiversity monitoring requirements that are required when building any
                        sort of offshore infrastrture, but also just gives you some really beautiful and cool results. I
                        love when we can spot crabs and flatfish in our models after going around with our ROV, it's a
                        non-instrusive way of getting a very good idea of what this underwater world actually looks
                        like.
